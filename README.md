# Purpose and Motivation
I made FilmSpot as a way to browse movies that you would want to watch given the vast array of movies on the site. The reason I decided to make FilmSpot was when a user watched a movie they could store it into their Favorites so they could remember what movies to reccomend to their friends by checking their favorites! It also provides the user to store a movie to their own movie list if the movie is somehow not on the database.

# How It Works

## Login Or Register
When you first visit the site, it will prompt you to login. If you don't have an account already there will be a register link under the "Login" Button that will allow you to make your account.

## Film List
This is where all of the sites movies will be shown so a user can decide which movie they would like to watch or store into their favorites.

Right under the nav bar there is the search function, where if you type in what ever movie your thinking about, it will choose movies with every keyboard press till you have found the one you want.

Every movie listed is clickable where when you click on a movie it will take you to a page where it will give you the information of "clicked" movie and the ability to favorite it with the "favorite" button
