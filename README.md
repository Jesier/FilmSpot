# Purpose and Motivation
I made FilmSpot as a way to browse movies that you would want to watch given the vast array of movies on the site. The reason I decided to make FilmSpot was when a user watched a movie they could store it into their Favorites so they could remember what movies to reccomend to their friends by checking their favorites! It also provides the user to store a movie to their own movie list if the movie is somehow not on the database.

# How It Works

## Login Or Register
When you first visit the site, it will prompt you to login. If you don't have an account already there will be a register link under the *Login* Button that will allow you to make your account.

## Film List
This is where all of the sites movies will be shown so a user can decide which movie they would like to watch or store into their favorites.

Right under the nav bar there is the search function, where if you type in what ever movie your thinking about, it will choose movies with every keyboard press till you have found the one you want.

Every movie listed is clickable where when you click on a movie it will take you to a page where it will give you the information of *clicked* movie.

## Adding a Favorite
When you click on a Film image from the list mentioned above, you will taken the films information. At the bottom of the synopsis there will be a favorite button that will add that movie to the users favorites that are stored in the *Favoties* section of the navbar.

## Creating a Film
Users have the capability to create and post new films for their own accounts. This is done by going to StoreFilms on the navbar and by filing out the fields then clicking the submit button to have it stored.

## Editing a Film
Users can edit their own film. The user can edit their film by going over to **YourFilms**. Once they are there every movie they have created should have a edit button right under it where they can change what they want by changing whats on the input forms. Once done click the *Save* button.

## Deleting a Film
From the editing portion above the user will also find the delete button right next to the edit button. If they were to click it it would delete the film out of the database.

## Logout
When the user clicks the *Logout* on the navbar, they will no longer be in their account anymore and will be taken to the Login page.

### How FilmSpot was Developed
FilmSpot was developed by me (Jesier Santiago) as a school project
