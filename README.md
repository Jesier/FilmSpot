# Purpose and Motivation
I made FilmSpot as a way to browse movies that you would want to watch given the vast array of movies on the site. The reason I decided to make FilmSpot was when a user watched a movie they could store it into their Favorites so they could remember what movies to reccomend to their friends by checking their favorites! It also provides the user to store a movie to their own movie list if the movie is somehow not on the database.
